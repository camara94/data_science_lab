# data_science_lab
Once you’ve completed the 8 lab projects, you will be able to source data, summarize it in statistics and visualizations, and model trends that power decision making at the business level. With your well-recognized Credly badge, you will be armed to let employers and colleagues know of your impressive achievement.  The more you actively engage with your peers, the more you will get from the course. We know some of this material is super hard; we encourage you to stick with it, to ask for help, and to make the most of all the coursework and projects have to offer.  In exchange for this free opportunity, we will be periodically asking you for your feedback. Please take providing your response seriously as it is the best tool we’ve got to improve the curriculum and learning experience. We are relying on you to help us make the course the best it can be well into the future.
